#This project provisions a load-balanced, auto-scaling web application on AWS. When the EC2 instances hit 100% CPU usage, the Auto Scaling Group automatically scales from 2 to 4 instances.

[load balanced auto scaling web app diagram.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20843834/load.balanced.auto.scaling.web.app.diagram.pdf)

**Key Components:**
- EC2 Launch Template  
- Auto Scaling Group (Min: 2, Max: 4 instances)  
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)  
- Target Group (attached to the ALB)  
- Amazon Linux 2 AMI  
- Manual stress test (no CloudWatch alarm configured)


 ## Full Project steps
 In this project, I created a basic but powerful AWS infrastructure that hosts a simple web app using EC2 instances. The system is designed to automatically scale out when CPU usage gets high, I used AWS services like Launch Templates, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), and a little stress testing to simulate real-world traffic.


üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Created a Launch Template (No Key Pair Used)
The first thing I did was create a Launch Template ‚Äî this is like a recipe that tells AWS how to launch EC2 instances automatically.

I picked Amazon Linux 2 as the base OS.

Chose t2.micro (free-tier eligible) as the instance type.

I did not select a key pair (so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to SSH, but that was okay for this project).

I created and attached a Security Group that allows:

Port 80 (for web traffic)

Port 22 (just in case I wanted to use EC2 Instance Connect)

The Launch Template helps the Auto Scaling Group know what kind of EC2 instance to launch, and with what settings.

üåê Step 2: Added User Data to Install Apache Web Server
While creating the Launch Template, I also added a User Data script. This is a short Bash script that automatically installs and starts Apache whenever a new EC2 instance is launched.

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
This sets up a basic website that shows which EC2 instance is handling the request (based on its hostname).

üéØ Step 3: Created a Target Group
Next, I created a Target Group, which is a collection of EC2 instances that sit behind the Load Balancer.

I chose Target Type: instance

Used HTTP protocol on port 80

Left the default health check settings (it checks / on port 80)

The Target Group is what the Load Balancer uses to route traffic to the right instances.

‚òÅÔ∏è Step 4: Set Up an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Then I created an Application Load Balancer ‚Äî this makes sure that traffic is evenly distributed between all healthy instances.

I made it internet-facing so it‚Äôs accessible to users over the web.

I selected 2 public subnets in different Availability Zones (for high availability).

I created a listener on port 80, which listens for incoming web requests.

I connected it to the Target Group I made earlier.

Now, the ALB will direct traffic to the instances managed by the Auto Scaling Group.

üîÅ Step 5: Created an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
Now that the Launch Template, Target Group, and ALB were ready, I created an Auto Scaling Group.

I linked it to the Launch Template

I selected the same 2 Availability Zones as the ALB

I attached the Target Group and ALB to the ASG

I configured the scaling settings:

Minimum instances: 2

Desired instances: 2

Maximum instances: 4

This means the ASG would always keep 2 instances running and could scale up to 4 if needed ‚Äî automatically.

üî• Step 6: Simulated High CPU Usage (Without SSH Key)
Since I didn‚Äôt use a key pair, I couldn‚Äôt SSH from my terminal ‚Äî but I was able to connect using EC2 Instance Connect, a browser-based terminal in the AWS Console.

Once I connected, I installed a tool called stress to simulate high CPU usage:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Enable EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable epel

# Install EPEL and the stress tool
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y stress

# Find out how many CPU cores the instance has
CPU_CORES=$(nproc)

# Use all cores to simulate CPU overload
stress --cpu "$CPU_CORES"
This caused the instance to hit 100% CPU, and after a few minutes, the Auto Scaling Group automatically launched more instances to handle the load.

üìà Step 7: Watched It Scale Automatically
After running the stress test:

I saw my EC2 instance count go from 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4.

All new instances automatically registered with the Target Group.

The ALB began spreading traffic between them without me touching anything.

## Deployment method
## üöÄ How to Deploy This Project on AWS

### 1. Create a Launch Template
- Go to *EC2 > Launch Templates*.
- Click *Create launch template*.
- Fill in:
  - Name (e.g. web-app-template)
  - Amazon Linux 2 AMI
  - t2.micro instance type
  - User data script to install Apache and the sample web page:
    
    #!/bin/bash
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Welcome to my Load Balanced Auto Scaling Web App!</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    

---

### 2. Create an Auto Scaling Group
- Go to *EC2 > Auto Scaling > Auto Scaling Groups*.
- Click *Create Auto Scaling group*.
- Attach the *Launch Template* you created.
- Set:
  - *Minimum capacity:* 2  
  - *Desired capacity:* 2  
  - *Maximum capacity:* 4
- Choose *2 subnets* in different Availability Zones (AZs).
- Enable *Application Load Balancer* in the next step (see below).
- Set *Scaling policy*:
  - Target tracking policy: *Average CPU utilization = 80%*.

---

### 3. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Go to *EC2 > Load Balancers > Create Load Balancer > Application Load Balancer*.
- Name it (e.g., web-alb)
- Scheme: *Internet-facing*, IP type: *IPv4*
- Choose *at least 2 subnets* in different AZs.
- Create a new *security group* that allows HTTP (port 80).
- Create a new *Target Group* of type *EC2 instances*:
  - Protocol: HTTP, Port: 80
- Listener: Add a rule to forward traffic to this target group.

---

### 4. Attach ASG to the Target Group
- Back in the Auto Scaling Group setup:
  - Select the *Target Group* you just created to register instances automatically.

---

### 5. Run CPU Stress Script (SSH into One EC2 Instance)
- Once your instances are running and reachable via the ALB, SSH into one instance:
  ```bash
  ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>
Se

### 6. Run the cpu stress tool to simulate high Load 
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable epel
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y stress
stress --cpu $(nproc)



## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet scalable and highly available web application on AWS using core services like Launch Templates, Auto Scaling Groups, and Application Load Balancers,By using a startup script to automatically install a web server and a stress tool to simulate high CPU usage, I was able to observe real-time scaling behavior in response to demand.

What I learned is that with just a few well-configured AWS services, you can create an infrastructure that heals itself, scales automatically, and distributes traffic intelligently ‚Äî without writing a single line of backend code or managing physical servers.
